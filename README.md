# Company Polling App
An app that allows users to fill out polls for different companies and submit them

## Running the App for development
To run the app, you need to write `npm start` in the terminal in the directory `company-polls`.
That way the Angular CLI starts watching for changes in the frontend code, and nodemon starts watching for changes in the Node JS backend server.
